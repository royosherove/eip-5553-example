## Simple Summary
A standardized way to manage web3 musical works and the composition(a.k.a WRITER/COMPOSITION/PUBLISHING) and recording (a.k.a MASTER) royalty splits related to these works, to enable universal support for future licensing and payment for usage of musical works on web3, across all music related marketplaces and ecosystem participants.


## Abstract
This standard allows martket participannts:
1) Observe the canonical version (single source of truth) of a musical work on chain
2) Discover its attached metadata
3) Discover its related recording and writing royalty splits and their owners
4) Create their own song ledger contract with specialized logic that can mint a new musical work, including its associated metadata and relevant roaytly tokens, and do an initial split among a predefined set of addresses
5) In the future, this will enable new licensing and payout mechanisms that are built on top of this structure.

This is intended for any web3 music platform that wants to mint or bring music on chain, and would like to add industry standard royalty pardagims into web3. 

The standard includes:
1) `SongRegNft` - the canonical song representation
2) `SongLedger` - the ledger that mints & holds the song
3) `BaseMusicRoyaltyToken` - the base token that is itself deriving from `ERC20`, and from which the recording and composition tokens will inherit. (Limited to 100 each, to represent 100% of royalty ownership)
4) `RecordingRoyaltyToken` - based on `BaseMusicRoyaltyToken`
5) `CompositionRoyaltyToken` - based on `BaseMusicRoyaltyToken` 

The exact mechanism for paying and licensing music works will be defined in future EIPs. This ERC should be considered a minimal, building block for further innovation in music works royalty payments, including but not limited to music NFTs. 

## Motivation
Music creators who intend to bring their music into web3 have but a single option today: onboard it as a sort of music or video NFT. 
On the other hand, user and business who would like to *use* this music and would like to license it have no way of doing it today, as there is no mechanism that allows licensing and paying for music works for industry standard uses such as streaming, sync licensing (in movies, TV, ads and trailers for example), metaverse usage, gaming usage and more. 

As a result of this limited capacity for music NFTs, lots of money that people would happily pay for using someone's music, are left on the table, and music creators basically mentally decide that they will release the song for free, and only get money from NFT sales, when in fact, standards alreadfy exist that allow people to license and pay for music usage in the real world.

Without an agreed musical work recording and composition royalty standard, the music ecosystem will lack an effective means to license and collect royalties for any music usage, and will be stuck in only NFT purchase royalties mode.  

At a glance, here's an example conversation summarizing Music NFT royalty payments today:

>**Business**: "Can I license your web3 music NFT?"          
>**Artist**: "Nope. You can only purchase it. it does not give you any rights to use it unless I specifically write cusotm metadata for it"          

>**band**: "Can I onboard my song that we wrote into your marketplace? here is out splits composition and recording"              
>**Marketplace**: "sorry, we only support a single type of royalty. it is up to use to do the splits yourself, and change them manually every time to change splits"              

### A quick note on recording and composition royalties
The concept of recording (aka 'master') royalties and composition (aks 'writing' or 'publishing') royalties has existed for a long time in the music industry. Just like metadata standards that allow giving credit to the people who took part in the creation of your music, so do recording and composition royalties play a part if helping to pay out people for the part they played in the creation of the song.

Recording royalties are often whatever you pay when you stream or use a recording of a song, so whoever took part in that recording, should get paid some "split". this often includes vocalists, players, mix engineers, producers and more.

Composition royalties belong to whoever came up with the concept of the musical work: wrote the lyrics, composed the notes. This composition can exist in someone's head without ever being recorded, hence the difference between recording and composition. These royalties often belong to whoever "wrote" the song's lyrics and came up up with the music that the words are sang to. Often it is the song writer and the producer who might also be the composer.

It is up to the group of people to decide who gets what split of each type, and in the real world, this is a very time consuming and logicial nightmare, wherin each collaborator needs to write down these splits in their own colleciton soceieties (BMI,ascap etc) and repeat the process for each collaborator.

Paying for these splits and keeping them up to date in the traditional music industry is yet another nightmare and often people can take 6-18 months to get paid (it can even take more than tat in some instances).

However, in web3, with smart contracts, we can take the essence of the recording and composition ideas, and speed up the process of payment, splitting and money distribution since we are dealing with smart contracts. 

This leaves us with all the benefits of paying writers and recording artists fairly, without the hassle of a web2 manual model of aplits and money collection.

Services like Royal.io have been pushing this one step forward and allow web2 music artists to mint NFTs that provide ability to recive royalties from web2 streaming, but they fall short in that they only support recording royalties, and only established artists that already have their songs out in the web2 world. 


## Specification (TBD - ignore anything below this)

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
RFC 2119.

**ERC-721 and ERC-1155 compliant contracts MAY implement this ERC for royalties to provide a standard method of specifying royalty payment information.**

Marketplaces that support this standard **SHOULD** implement some method of transferring royalties to the royalty recipient. Standards for the actual transfer and notification of funds will be specified in future EIPs.

Marketplaces **MUST** pay the royalty in the same unit of exchange as that of the `_salePrice` passed to `royaltyInfo()`. This is equivalent to saying that the `_salePrice` parameter and the `royaltyAmount` return value **MUST** be denominated in the same monetary unit. For example, if the sale price is in ETH, then the royalty payment must also be paid in ETH, and if the sale price is in USDC, then the royalty payment must also be paid in USDC.

Implementers of this standard **MUST** calculate a percentage of the `_salePrice` when calculating the royalty amount. Subsequent invocations of `royaltyInfo()` **MAY** return a different `royaltyAmount`. Though there are some important considerations for implementers if they choose to perform different percentage calculations between `royaltyInfo()` invocations.

The `royaltyInfo()` function is not aware of the unit of exchange for the sale and royalty payment. With that in mind, implementers **MUST NOT** return a fixed/constant `royaltyAmount`, wherein they're ignoring the `_salePrice`. For the same reason, implementers **MUST NOT** determine the `royaltyAmount` based on comparing the `_salePrice` with constant numbers. In both cases, the `royaltyInfo()` function makes assumptions on the unit of exchange, which **MUST** be avoided.

The percentage value used must be independent of the sale price for reasons previously mentioned (i.e. if the percentage value 10%, then 10% **MUST** apply whether `_salePrice` is 10, 10000 or 1234567890). If the royalty fee calculation results in a remainder, implementers **MAY** round up or round down to the nearest integer. For example, if the royalty fee is 10% and `_salePrice` is 999, the implementer can return either 99 or 100 for `royaltyAmount`, both are valid.

The implementer **MAY** choose to change the percentage value based on other predictable variables that do not make assumptions about the unit of exchange. For example, the percentage value may drop linearly over time. An approach like this **SHOULD NOT** be based on variables that are unpredictable like `block.timestamp`, but instead on other more predictable state changes. One more reasonable approach **MAY** use the number of transfers of an NFT to decide which percentage value is used to calculate the `royaltyAmount`. The idea being that the percentage value could decrease after each transfer of the NFT. Another example could be using a different percentage value for each unique `_tokenId`.

Marketplaces that support this standard **SHOULD NOT** send a zero-value transaction if the `royaltyAmount` returned is `0`. This would waste gas and serves no useful purpose in this EIP.

Marketplaces that support this standard **MUST** pay royalties no matter where the sale occurred or in what currency, including on-chain sales, over-the-counter (OTC) sales and off-chain sales such as at auction houses. As royalty payments are voluntary, entities that respect this EIP must pay no matter where the sale occurred - a sale conducted outside of the blockchain is still a sale. The exact mechanism for paying and notifying the recipient will be defined in future EIPs.

Implementers of this standard **MUST** have all of the following functions:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.6.0;
import "./IERC165.sol";

///
/// @dev Interface for the NFT Royalty Standard
///
interface IERC2981 is IERC165 {
    /// ERC165 bytes to add to interface array - set in parent contract
    /// implementing this standard
    ///
    /// bytes4(keccak256("royaltyInfo(uint256,uint256)")) == 0x2a55205a
    /// bytes4 private constant _INTERFACE_ID_ERC2981 = 0x2a55205a;
    /// _registerInterface(_INTERFACE_ID_ERC2981);

    /// @notice Called with the sale price to determine how much royalty
    //          is owed and to whom.
    /// @param _tokenId - the NFT asset queried for royalty information
    /// @param _salePrice - the sale price of the NFT asset specified by _tokenId
    /// @return receiver - address of who should be sent the royalty payment
    /// @return royaltyAmount - the royalty payment amount for _salePrice
    function royaltyInfo(
        uint256 _tokenId,
        uint256 _salePrice
    ) external view returns (
        address receiver,
        uint256 royaltyAmount
    );
}

interface IERC165 {
    /// @notice Query if a contract implements an interface
    /// @param interfaceID The interface identifier, as specified in ERC-165
    /// @dev Interface identification is specified in ERC-165. This function
    ///  uses less than 30,000 gas.
    /// @return `true` if the contract implements `interfaceID` and
    ///  `interfaceID` is not 0xffffffff, `false` otherwise
    function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceID) external view returns (bool);
}
```

### Examples

This standard being used on an ERC-721 during deployment:

#### Deploying an ERC-721 and signaling support for ERC-2981

```solidity
constructor (string memory name, string memory symbol, string memory baseURI) {
        _name = name;
        _symbol = symbol;
        _setBaseURI(baseURI);
        // register the supported interfaces to conform to ERC721 via ERC165
        _registerInterface(_INTERFACE_ID_ERC721);
        _registerInterface(_INTERFACE_ID_ERC721_METADATA);
        _registerInterface(_INTERFACE_ID_ERC721_ENUMERABLE);
        // Royalties interface
        _registerInterface(_INTERFACE_ID_ERC2981);
    }
```

#### Checking if the NFT being sold on your marketplace implemented royalties

```solidity  
bytes4 private constant _INTERFACE_ID_ERC2981 = 0x2a55205a;

function checkRoyalties(address _contract) internal returns (bool) {
    (bool success) = IERC165(_contract).supportsInterface(_INTERFACE_ID_ERC2981);
    return success;
 }
```

## Rationale

### Optional royalty payments

It is impossible to know which NFT transfers are the result of sales, and which are merely wallets moving or consolidating their NFTs. Therefore, we cannot force every transfer function, such as `transferFrom()` in ERC-721, to involve a royalty payment as not every transfer is a sale that would require such payment. We believe the NFT marketplace ecosystem will voluntarily implement this royalty payment standard to provide ongoing funding for artists/creators. NFT buyers will assess the royalty payment as a factor when making NFT purchasing decisions.

### Simple royalty payments to a single address

This EIP does not specify the manner of payment to the royalty recipient. Furthermore, it is impossible to fully know and efficiently implement all possible types of royalty payments logic. With that said, it is on the royalty payment receiver to implement all additional complexity and logic for fee splitting, multiple receivers, taxes, accounting, etc. in their own receiving contract or off-chain processes. Attempting to do this as part of this standard, it would dramatically increase the implementation complexity, increase gas costs, and could not possibly cover every potential use-case. This ERC should be considered a minimal, gas-efficient building block for further innovation in NFT royalty payments. Future EIPs can specify more details regarding payment transfer and notification.

### Royalty payment percentage calculation

This EIP mandates a percentage-based royalty fee model. It is likely that the most common case of percentage calculation will be where the `royaltyAmount` is always calculated from the `_salePrice` using a fixed percent i.e. if the royalty fee is 10%, then a 10% royalty fee must apply whether `_salePrice` is 10, 10000 or 1234567890.

As previously mentioned, implementers can get creative with this percentage-based calculation but there are some important caveats to consider. Mainly, ensuring that the `royaltyInfo()` function is not aware of the unit of exchange and that unpredictable variables are avoided in the percentage calculation. To follow up on the earlier `block.timestamp` example, there is some nuance which can be highlighted if the following events ensued:

1. Marketplace sells NFT.
2. Marketplace delays `X` days before invoking `royaltyInfo()` and sending payment.
3. Marketplace receives `Y` for `royaltyAmount` which was significantly different from the `royaltyAmount` amount that would've been calculated `X` days prior if no delay had occurred.
4. Royalty recipient is dissatisfied with the delay from the marketplace and for this reason, they raise a dispute.

Rather than returning a percentage and letting the marketplace calculate the royalty amount based on the sale price, a `royaltyAmount` value is returned so there is no dispute with a marketplace over how much is owed for a given sale price. The royalty fee payer must pay the `royaltyAmount` that `royaltyInfo()` stipulates.

### Unit-less royalty payment across all marketplaces, both on-chain and off-chain

This EIP does not specify a currency or token used for sales and royalty payments. The same percentage-based royalty fee must be paid regardless of what currency, or token was used in the sale, paid in the same currency or token. This applies to sales in any location including on-chain sales, over-the-counter (OTC) sales, and off-chain sales using fiat currency such as at auction houses. As royalty payments are voluntary, entities that respect this EIP must pay no matter where the sale occurred - a sale outside of the blockchain is still a sale. The exact mechanism for paying and notifying the recipient will be defined in future EIPs.

### Universal Royalty Payments

Although designed specifically with NFTs in mind, this standard does not require that a contract implementing EIP-2981 is compatible with either ERC-721 or ERC-1155 standards. Any other contract could use this interface to return royalty payment information, provided that it is able to uniquely identify assets within the constraints of the interface. ERC-2981 is, therefore, a universal royalty standard for many other asset types.

## Backwards Compatibility

This standard is compatible with current ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards.
